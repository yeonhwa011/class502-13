# CTS [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/orbisgis/cts.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/orbisgis/cts)

Coordinate Transformation Suite (abridged CTS)  is a library developed to
perform coordinate transformations using well known geodetic algorithms and
parameter sets.  It strives to be simple, flexible and interoperable, in this
order.

#### History

Originally developed by Michaël Michaud under the name of JGeod, the library was
renamed to CTS in 2009.  Today CTS is maintained by the OrbisGIS team in
collaboration with Michaël Michaud.

The new CTS has been funded by the French *Agence Nationale de la Recherche* (ANR) under
research contract ANR-08-VILL-0005-01 and the regional council of the *Région Pays
de La Loire* under the *Système d'Orbservation Géographique de la Ville*
(SOGVILLE) project.
